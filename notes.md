# Notes

# Version 1:

Static does not work well when purely random. Original structure is still clearly visible, although not sure how this would affest an AI.

Static does convert back to original image properly, so transparent \<img\> elements would work.

Perhaps reigonal static, since having static in an area
allows the human eye to average the image out automatically.

As another note, this static division method will
eventually drive some of the images to their
maximum or minimum values, from where they can be changed no more. Thie may account for some of the problems-- maybe there is an advanced image-to-static library out there?
